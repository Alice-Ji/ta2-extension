# TA² — Your Teaching Co-Pilot ✏️🤖  

**An LLM-powered grading assistant for overworked TAs, grad instructors, and adjuncts.**  
*Built with AI, for grading with AI, where user friction and rapid prototyping co-evolved the product.*

---

## 🧠 What It Is

TA² is a browser extension that lives inside **Canvas SpeedGrader** and helps instructors generate fast, customized, tone-appropriate feedback using an LLM.

It:

- Reads student submissions directly in SpeedGrader *(never stored)*
- Lets you input a rubric once per assignment
- Generates a suggested **grade + feedback comment**
- Includes **one-click copy** to paste into Canvas

Think:  
> *“Clippy, but for desperate grad students and adjuncts grading 120 papers.”*
